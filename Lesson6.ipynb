    "## What Is Object-Oriented Programming ?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, We have learned what is a brick, concrete and wood in Python language. Now, let's focus on how do we build a house from what we have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of attributes and their behavior in the form of methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of objects is that an object's methods can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Object has its own attributes, and behavior. Objects are separate from one another. They have their own existence, their own identity that is independent of other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you consider the Biggest Loser challenge, each member can be an object with a name, age, gender as its attributes and wether active participant or not can be it's behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well, how do we construct this objects in our program? Class!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Class?\n",
    "Well, a class is a place where you can identify the behaviors and properties of an Object. So, the properties and behavior of an Object will be defined inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tclass ClassName:\n",
    "\t\t'Optional class documentation string'\n",
    "\t\tclass_suite\n",
    "```\n",
    "> *The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via ```python ClassName.__doc__```*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The class_suite consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes, and functions.*\n",
    "\n",
