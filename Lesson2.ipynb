    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. In simple words, they are containers that hold information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "They provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, by storing data in a variable, you can access this data anywhere in your program without duplicating it. Therefore, it's easier to read and manipulate the data throughout your program\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to assign a value to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myVar = 42\n",

    "\n",
    "That's it! Easy right?\n",
