    "A CSV is a comma separated values file which allows data to be saved in a table structured format. A CSV file is similar to an Excel spreadsheet, though it doesn't have the style formatting and has a .csv extension instead. Traditionally they take the form of a text file containing information separated by commas, hence the name.\n",

    "    1. To be the first team to reach 1 million steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. To have the highest overall step count amongst all teams\n",

    "    3. To show the most improved team step count (from weeks 1+2 to weeks 3+4)\n",
